<h2><u>What Is Agasti?</u></h2>
<p>Agasti is the PHP based project of the Sahana Software Foundation. Based a long-term preparedness for disaster management, Agasti aims to provide scalability; whether for major cities or micro event response.</p>

<p>With the formation of the Agasti Project Management Committee, the PHP branch of Sahana has a new burst of activity and momentum as well as the history of Sahana behind it. There are currently three versions of Agasti with active development: Krakatoa (formerly Sahana 0.6.3), Vesuvius, and the newest version Mayon.</p>

<p>Each version is actively seeking contributors including application developers, documentation writers, translators, managers, QA specialists, and emergency response specialists interested in helping to refine the current versions, and push ahead with creation of the newest versions. For more information about how you can help visit the Agasti wiki at http://wiki.sahanafoundation.org/doku.php/agasti:start.</p>

<h3>Agasti's Mission</h3>

<p>The mission of Sahana Agasti is to facilitate resource management and communication throughout all phases of emergency management by providing a turnkey open-source application that is reliable, scalable, extensible, and usable both by volunteers and professionals, and which supports the primary goal of the Sahana Software Foundation: alleviating human suffering and saving lives.</p>

* minimum 512 MB RAM</p>

<hr>
<h2><u>Known Issues</u></h2>

<p>* <b>IMPORTANT GENERAL NOTE</b>: this is the initial trunk foundation for the Mayon release. It is not intended for production use and the devlopment team is aware multiple modules may be missing and functionality is limited.</p>
<p>* After initially filling in the install.php form it may take up to 5 minutes to
  load and redirect to the login screen.</p>

<p>* Many navigation links point to home for modules that will be implemented in
future releases.</p>

<p>* Pre-loaded fixtures for staff are not searchable; this is because fixture data
is not currently indexed for searching when populating the schema through the
install process. Any new data entered into the system, however, will be
searchable.</p>
<p>* The formatting on some pages may seem "off." Page elements may wrap or
disappear based on your browser window size or screen resolution. As a
temporary workaround, you may need to maximize your browser window or increase
your screen resolution.</p>
<p>* Caching solutions are not included with this version of trunk.</p>
<p><b>If you think you've found a new issue or bug, please refer to the "Support" section above for information on how to contact our volunteer community.</b></p>

<h3>Contributior License Agreement</h3>
<p>The Sahana Software Foundation (SSF) requires a Contributor License Agreement
(CLA) to be signed and returned by all Members, PMC members and Committers and
requests them of anyone contributing their intellectual property (code or design
requirements or ideas) to Sahana projects. This serves to protect everyone's
rights and ensures SSF can legally and publicly redistribute Sahana's code. The
purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which
intellectual property has been contributed to the SSF and thereby allow us to
defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at
some future time. SSF committees will be responsible for ensuring that all code
contributions come from only those who have signed a CLA before merging code
into the trunk. (So if you don't sign and return a CLA, your code contributions
will not become a part of the main development branch of Sahana nor will it be
included in any releases from the Sahana Software Foundation).</p>

<p> Below are guidelines to get you started with properly formatted code.  For full details on our coding standards (with examples) please visit http://wiki.sahanafoundation.org/doku.php/agasti:developer:coding_guidelines

<h3>General</h3>

<p># Do not use backticks for executing shell code.<br>
# Use full-form tags to delimit PHP code. Do not include an end tag at the end of the file.<br>
# Do not suppress error reporting. Leave this to the web server configuration.</p>

<h3>Comments and Documentation</h3>
<p># All classes should begin with a title block describing the basics of the class and the author at a minimum.<br>
# All public functions should be labelled using Doxygen commands.  A basic description should be included before the declaration.<br>
# Use Doxygen-compatible comments to document function purpose and usage. You can learn how to use Doxygen at the following URL: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html </P.
