          <h2><u>What Is Agasti?</u></h2>
          <p>Agasti is the PHP based project of the Sahana Software Foundation. Based a long-term preparedness for disaster management, Agasti aims to provide scalability; whether for major cities or micro event response.</p>

          <p>With the formation of the Agasti Project Management Committee, the PHP branch of Sahana has a new burst of activity and momentum as well as the history of Sahana behind it. There are currently three versions of Agasti with active development: Krakatoa (formerly Sahana 0.6.3), Vesuvius, and the newest version Mayon.</p>

          <p>Each version is actively seeking contributors including application developers, documentation writers, translators, managers, QA specialists, and emergency response specialists interested in helping to refine the current versions, and push ahead with creation of the newest versions. For more information about how you can help visit the Agasti wiki at http://wiki.sahanafoundation.org/doku.php/agasti:start.</p>

          <h3>Agasti's Mission</h3>

          <p>The mission of Sahana Agasti is to facilitate resource management and communication throughout all phases of emergency management by providing a turnkey open-source application that is reliable, scalable, extensible, and usable both by volunteers and professionals, and which supports the primary goal of the Sahana Software Foundation: alleviating human suffering and saving lives.</p>

                                        <h2><u>Known Issues</u></h2>

                                        <p>* <b>IMPORTANT GENERAL NOTE</b>: this is the initial trunk foundation for the Mayon release. It is not intended for production use and the devlopment team is aware multiple modules may be missing and functionality is limited.</p>
                                        <p>* After initially filling in the install.php form it may take up to 5 minutes to
                                          load and redirect to the login screen.</p>

                                        <p>* Many navigation links point to home for modules that will be implemented in
                                          future releases.</p>

                                        <p>* Pre-loaded fixtures for staff are not searchable; this is because fixture data
                                          is not currently indexed for searching when populating the schema through the
                                          install process. Any new data entered into the system, however, will be
                                          searchable.</p>
                                        <p>* The formatting on some pages may seem "off." Page elements may wrap or
                                          disappear based on your browser window size or screen resolution. As a
                                          temporary workaround, you may need to maximize your browser window or increase
                                          your screen resolution.</p>
                                        <p>* Caching solutions are not included with this version of trunk.</p>
                                        <p><b>If you think you've found a new issue or bug, please refer to the "Support" section above for information on how to contact our volunteer community.</b></p>

                                            will not become a part of the main development branch of Sahana nor will it be
