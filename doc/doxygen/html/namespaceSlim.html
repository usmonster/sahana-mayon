Log Adapter This is an adapter for your own custom Logger. This adapter assumes your custom Logger provides the following public instance methods:  debug( mixed $object ) info( mixed $object ) warn( mixed $object ) error( mixed $object ) fatal( mixed $object )  This class assumes nothing else about your custom Logger, so you are free to use Apache's Log4PHP logger or any other log class that, at the very least, implements the five public instance methods shown above.

Flash Messaging This class enables Flash messaging. Messages are persisted in $_SESSION with a user-defined key.  USAGE:  1. Set Flash message to be shown on the next request  Slim::flash('error', 'The object could not be saved');  2. Set Flash message to be shown on the current request  Slim::flashNow('error', 'The object could not be saved');  3. Keep old Flash messages for the next request  Slim::flashKeep();   Josh Lockhart  Version 1.3   Josh Lockhart  <a href="http://www.slimframework.com">http://www.slimframework.com</a>  2011 Josh Lockhart  MIT LICENSE  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:  The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Session Cookie Handler This class is used as an adapter for PHP's $_SESSION handling. Session data will be written to and read from signed, encrypted cookies. If the current PHP installation does not have the `mcrypt` extension, session data will be written to signed but unencrypted cookies; however, the session cookies will still be secure and will become invalid if manually edited after set by PHP.

Abstract Session Handler This abstract class should be extended by each concrete session handler. This class defines the contractual class interface methods that must be implemented in concrete subclasses. This class also provides the final `register` method used by Slim itself to actually register the concrete session handler with PHP.

Slim View The View is responsible for rendering and/or displaying a template. It is recommended that you subclass View and re-implement the `View::render` method to use a custom templating engine such as Smarty, Twig, Mustache, etc. It is important that `View::render` `return` the final template output. Do not `echo` the output.   Josh Lockhart &lt;<a href="mailto:info@joshlockhart.com">info@joshlockhart.com</a>&gt;  Version 1.0 </a></dd></dl>
