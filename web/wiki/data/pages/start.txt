====== Sahana 2.0 Manual ======

This is the Sahana Agasti 2.0 manual developed for the New York City Office of Emergency Management.

====== About Sahana ======

Sahana 2.0 was created by CUNY School of Professional Studies (SPS) under contract from the New York Office of Emergency Management (OEM), and currently is actively developed and supported by CUNY SPS and the greater Sahana software community.

Sahana 2.0 is an enterprise-class open source disaster management solution. The original project was initiated by volunteers in the Sri Lankan FOSS development community to help fellow country men and women affected during the December 2004 Asian Tsunami. It has been further developed and enhanced for New York City purposes by support from OEM.

Sahana 2.0 is free of cost. Sahana is written and distributed under the GPL General Public License version 2. It means that its source code is freely distributed and available for the general public.
