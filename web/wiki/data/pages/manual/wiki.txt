====== Wiki Manual ======
The internal documentation for Sahana Agasti lives in a wiki packaged with the software.  Below are basic instructions for how to use the wiki and for producing the books created in the wiki.  More details are readily available on the internet via the links in the reference section below.

===== Dokuwiki Basics =====
The most important thing to know when understanding Dokuwiki is wiki syntax.  Syntax is a special way of writing in the wiki that allows the text to be read by the software and easily viewed and formatted.  [[wiki:syntax|Dokuwiki Syntax]] is used in any installation of doku wiki and is included for easy reference (just click that link and you're off).  It's helpful to keep that page open as you write.

Should you want to edit the wiki log in by clicking the link in the upper right corner of the page using the username and password you log into Sahana Agasti with.  Next, click the edit tab that appears just below where you logged in.  Use the [[wiki:syntax|Dokuwiki Syntax]] to make any edits, then click 'Save' at the bottom.

===== Dokuwiki References =====

===== Creating Books =====
In the Sahana Agasti internal wiki books are managed by the [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:bookcreator?s[]=book|Book Creator Plugin]].  This plugin allows you to flag pages for inclusion in a book, save the book, save it as a PDF, and it to be printed.  You can also print any individual page as a PDF.

To print any books generated by this wiki go to the [[wiki:ebook|Ebook]] page, select the book you want to edit from the list, and save it as a PDF.  From the PDF file you can print as many copies as you require.
