====== Staff Management Walk-Through ======

===== Creating New Staff =====

Staff records in Agasti represent the potential workforce for your emergency response and there are two ways to add new records: manual and [[manual:user:staff:import]].  This page will walk you through creating a new staff resource manually and, later on in this walk-through, you'll be instructed on how to import a staff records file should you wish to maintain staff lists via an imported Microsoft Excel 2003 spreadsheet.

===== Reference Information =====

==== Things To Know ====

  * **Staff Resources** are used when creating staff deployment rules in a Scenario.  Staff Resources can be thought of as staff roles. Each individual staff member may provide multiple staff resources but will only be utilized as the type that has the most immediate need during deployment.  If you plan to use a portion of your available staff records (instead of all staff), or if you want to deploy some staff with a higher priority than others, be sure to add a staff's resource type and the [[manual:user:organizations|organization]] they are associated with to their record.
  * [[manual:user:organizations|Organization]] information can be customized through the Organization module and, ideally, will be entered before staff are created (though staff records can be updated later).

===== Walk-Through =====

From the Staff Management page click "Add Staff" to create a new staff record.  For ease of reference the walk-through for this page is broken up with instructions following the image for a section of the form.

===== FAQ =====

  * **What are Staff Resources?** - A "Staff Resource" is a person and their skills; for example a person with medical training can be labelled as a 'nurse' or 'doctor' in Agasti.  Later on, when a [[manual:user:scenario|scenario]] is created, deployment rules will also be created to dictate how staff will be assigned.  Instead of deploying individual staff the staff resource types will be determined and the available individuals matched to jobs.
  * **Why not just assign people to facilities?** - It's hard to know when planning an emergency response who is going to be affected and who is going to be available to respond.  To ensure the most needed roles are filled Agasti waits to know who is available; which happens during an active event.
