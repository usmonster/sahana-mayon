====== Staff Management Walk-Through ======


===== Import Staff =====
While staff can be entered manually in Sahana Agasti large staff lists are more easily entered via import.  


===== Reference Information =====
==== Things to Know ====
  * If you are updating existing records in Sahana Agasti, use the [[manual:user:staff:export|Staff Export]] feature to create a spreadsheet of existing records.  Sahana Agasti will match the "entity ID" of the updated record to the existing one to prevent duplication.

===== FAQ =====

  * **I want to update staff via import.  How do I prevent duplication?** Use staff export to create a report of the current staff and update that information.  The "Entity ID" of the record will be used during the import to identify any records that already exist in Sahana Agasti.
  * **Can I upload staff without any Resource Types?** Yes; though without resources associated the staff will not be available for deployment.
