====== Staff Management Walk-Through ======

In this walk-through we've reviewed how to enter staff, edit existing records, mass-import staff, and export records from Agasti.  These staff records will be used later for planning and potential deployment should an activation occur.

===== Key Concepts =====
  * **Staff Resource** - Staff Resources are used when creating staff deployment rules in a Scenario. If you plan to use a portion of your available staff records (instead of all staff), or if you want to deploy some staff with a higher priority than others, to add a staff's resource type and/or the organization they are associated with.
  * **Staff Pool** - The staff pool is the available staff selected to be part of a scenario.  The pool can be restricted by the needed staff resources and specific organizations so that only the needed staff are called for an activation.
  * **Scenario** - Scenarios are response plans in Sahana Agasti that mirror on-paper municiple response deployment plans.
  * **Event** - Events are active instances where scenarios are converted to real-time responses.

Using the manual and import methods of adding staff, continue expanding the potential staff pool in Sahana Agasti.  When the staff pool is built, continue on to [[manual:user:facilities|Facility Management]].
