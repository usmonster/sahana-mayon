====== Staff Management Walk-Through ======


===== List Staff =====
The Sahana Agasti Staff list makes it easy for administrators to update or locate individual staff or a group of staff records.  The list is sortable by status and searchable through the menu.
===== Reference Information =====
==== Things To Know ====

  * Even if a staff record has more than one resource they are only listed once.
  * The list defaults to show staff in "active" status.  To view all records adjust the dropdown in the upper right corner. {{:manual:user:staff:staff_status_dropdown.png|}}
