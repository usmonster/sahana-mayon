====== Event Management Quick Guide ======
Scenarios are plans; and events are the deployments of those plans in response to real-world emergencies.
Below are quick reference instructions for events.  More details are available in the [[manual:user:event:introduction|Event Management Tutorial]].

===== Reference Information =====


====== Deploying an Event ======
Below are basic instructions for deploying an event.  The last step of the Scenario Creator Tutorial, [[scenario:deployevent|Deploying an Event]] covers detailed navigation to event deployment.  More details on event management are available in the [[manual:user:event:introduction|Event Management Tutorial]].

=== Using the Menu ===
From the "Home" page:
  * Hover over "Respond" in the menu
  * Select "Deploy a Scenario" in the drop down
  * On the row for the Scenario you would like to deploy click "Deploy as Event".
  * Use the checks to verify that the scenario was completed and their is a large enough staff pool to contact for response (typically you should have more staff than you need in this step).
  * Enter a name for the event.
  * Set the Zero Hour for the event. **Zero Hour** is the time when the event _did_ occur or _will occur_.  Zero Hour defaults to the current time. **Important:** in Scenario you set what time before or after zero hour facilities should open.  You may want to verify those times on the Scenario Shift Template page to be sure you have them set at a correct ratio to Zero Hour.
  * To Save and wait in case you have more preparation, click "Save".  To deploy now click "Save and Deploy".  **Remember**: Once you save the event any updates to the Scenario it is based on will no longer affect it.
  * After deployment you will be redirected to the Event Management page for this event where you can access other functions in this event.
