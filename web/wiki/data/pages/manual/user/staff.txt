====== Staff Management Quick Guide ======

Managing staff is a key component of Agasti.  In an emergency response it's important to have up-to-date contact information for staff and volunteers as well as their roles in your response plan.  Agasti provides tools for these and more.  Below are quick-reference instructions for staff management.  For detailed how-to instruction see the [[manual:user:staff:staff_creation_walkthrough|Managing Staff Walk-Through]].

===== Staff Management Functions =====

In the Staff Management module a user can:
  * Enter staff records
    * Manually
    * Via Import
  * Edit staff records
  * Delete records
  * Export

In general the staff module is used to maintain staff records and prepare for the deployment of staff during an activation.  While staff information could be uploaded or entered in response to an event, if the records are available prior to an emergency response it will greatly increase the effectiveness if the initial response.

===== Staff Resources =====

A "Staff Resource" is a person combined with a skill set that is potentially available for emergency response.  For example: Erica is a nurse who volunteers with the Red Cross.  While Erica may not be directly assigned during the preparation phase of creating a scenario, the Typhoon scenario calls for 4 nurses.  When the Typhoon scenario is deployed as the "2011 Typhoon" event, Jane is available as a Staff Resource and deployed as a nurse by Sahana Agasti.

==== How Staff Are Used ====

Before understanding how staff are used in Sahana Agasti, it's helpful to understand Staff Resources.  **Staff Resources** can be thought of as staff roles. Each individual staff member may provide multiple staff resources but will only be utilized as the type that has the most immediate need during deployment.

Using the default automated deployment engine, staff resources are distributed according to the highest priority facility group, then highest priority facility within that group. As staff are distributed, once a facility has reached its minimum threshold, the next facility is queued to receive resource allocations until its minimum threshold is met and so on and so forth. Once all active facilities in all active facility groups have had their minimum requirements satisfied, staff are distributed in a round-robin fashion that shares resources equally until facilities reach their maximum capacities.

===== Entering Staff =====

Staff can be entered into Agasti in two ways: manually and via import.  Below are brief instructions for using both.  A walk-through is available for [[manual:user:staff:new|manual entry]] and [[manual:user:staff:import|import]].

    * **Other**
  - Select the Staff Resource Type
  - Select the Organization the staff member is affiliated with
  - Enter the available details regarding the staff member.  **Note**: for the most accurate deployment the staff member should provide their most accurate home and work addresses.  Address information is used to create staff assignments during deployment and inaccurate address information could result in the staff member having to travel farther during the response.
