====== Organization Management Walk-Through ======


===== Creating a New Organization =====
Organizations in Sahana Agasti are primarily used to group staff.  In a deployment you may wish to use staff of different types from particular responding organizations; such as prioritizing volunteers from the Red Cross above others because of the training they receive.

This page will walk you through creating a new organization record manually.

===== Reference Information =====

==== Things To Know ====
  * Organizations can be Non-Government Organizations, Government Departments, or volunteers.
  * It's a good idea to name your first Organization 'Volunteer' so one is available for extraneous staff.
  * An organization's **Name** is used throughout the application to reference that group.  The **Description** is used for reference when in the Organization module.

===== Walk-Through =====

In the form for a New Organization, add the name of the organization and a brief description.  **Reminder:** It's a good idea to create an organization called "Volunteer" for any unaffiliated staff that may want to help.
  * **Name**: the name of the organization or department
  * **Description**: a brief description for your reference
