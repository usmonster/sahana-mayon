====== Organization Management Walk-Through ======


===== Creating a New Organization =====
Organizations in Sahana Agasti are primarily used to group staff.  In a deployment you may wish to use staff of different types from particular responding organizations; such as prioritizing volunteers from the Red Cross above others because of the training they receive.

This page will walk you through creating a new organization record manually.

===== Reference Information =====

==== Things To Know ====
  * Organizations can be Non-Government Organizations, Government Departments, or volunteers.
  * It's a good idea to name your first Organization 'Volunteer' so one is available for extraneous staff.
  * An organization's **Name** is used throughout the application to reference that group.  The **Description** is used for reference when in the Organization module.

===== Creating New Staff =====

Staff records in Agasti represent the potential workforce for your emergency response and there are two ways to add new records: manual and [[manual:user:staff:import]].  This page will walk you through creating a new staff resource manually and, later on in this walk-through, you'll be instructed on how to import a staff records file should you desire to do so.

===== Reference Information =====

==== Things To Know ====

  * **Staff Resources** are used when creating staff deployment rules in a Scenario.  If you plan to use a portion of your available staff records (instead of all staff), or if you want to deploy some staff with a higher priority than others, to add a staff's resource type and/or the [[manual:user:organizations|organization]] they are associated with.
  * [[manual:user:organizations|Organization]] information can be customized through the Organization module and, ideally, will be entered before staff are created (though staff records can be updated later).

===== Walk-Through =====

In the form for a New Organization, add the name of the organization and a brief description.  **Reminder:** It's a good idea to create an organization called "Volunteer" for any unaffiliated staff that may want to help.
  * **Name**: the name of the organization or department
  * **Description**: a brief description for your reference
