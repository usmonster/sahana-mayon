====== Organization Management Walk-Through ======
In this walk-through we've reviewed how Organizations are used in Agasti and how to create, list, and edit Organization records.

===== Key Concepts =====
  * **Organizations in Staff Resources** - Staff records include "resources", the jobs they can be used in.  These resources are attached to Organizations.
  * **Organizations in Scenarios** - Scenarios are response plans and staff from certain organizations can be prioritized within each scenario for a highly customizable response.

====== Continue ======

Continue adding Organizations to Sahana Agasti until any government departments or NGOs you'll want available have been entered.  When the Organizations have been entered, continue on to [[manual:user:staff|Staff Management]].
