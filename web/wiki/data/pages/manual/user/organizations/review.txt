====== Organization Management Walk-Through ======
===== Review =====

In this walk-through we've reviewed how Organizations are used in Agasti and how to create, list, and edit Organization records.

===== Key Concepts =====
  * **Organizations in Staff Resources** - Staff records include "resources": the jobs they can be used in.  These resources are attached to Organizations for sorting and grouping
  * **Organizations in Scenarios** - Scenarios are response plans and staff from certain organizations can be prioritized within each scenario for a highly customizable response.

====== Continue ======

Continue adding Organizations to Sahana Agasti for any government departments or NGOs whose staff may be available in an active event.  When you're ready, continue on to [[manual:user:staff|Staff Management]].
