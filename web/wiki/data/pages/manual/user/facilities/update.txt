====== Facility Management Tutorial ======

===== Updating a Facility Record =====
For scenarios to be current and deployment reliable it's important that records can be updated regularly.  There are two ways to update Facility records: manually and via import.  Below are instructions for manually updating a facility record; updating facility records via import is in the Scenario Creator Tutorial.
===== Reference Information =====
==== Things To Know ====
  * By now you know that a Facility Resource is the combination of a physical location (facility) in Sahana Agasti and the Resource that is available at that facility in a response.  To ensure staff is deployed to accurate locations it's important to keep facility records up to date.
===== Tutorial =====
Beginning on the Facility Management page click the List Facilities link to view facility records in Sahana Agasti:

For ease of reference, the different sections and possible updates are outlined in the breakdowns below:
==== Facility Name and Facility Code ====
{{:manual:user:facilities:fac_name_fac_res.png|Facility Name and Facility Resource}}
=== Facility Name ===
Facility Name is used as a label for the user, but not considered "unique" or used as an identifier in Sahana Agasti.  It can be updated as much as is desired by the user.

=== Facility Code ===
The Facility Code is the unique identifier of the Facility record in Sahana Agasti.  **Important:** Facility Code __must__ be unique to each facility.  Updating the Facility Code, or changing it on import, can cause problems with deployment and duplication.
