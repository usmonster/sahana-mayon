====== Scenario Creator Walk-through ======

===== Scenario Shifts =====
In the last step, we created a shift template that was used to generate shifts. This page gives emergency managers the opportunity to review the created shifts, edit them directly, or add new ones.

===== Reference Information =====

==== Important Concepts ====
  * Individual shifts can be altered; but this will not affect later shifts.  If you edit a staff members first shift, changing the break from 8 hours to 6, the later shifts will remain 8 hours.
  * **If shifts are regenerated, custom shifts are lost.**  If you return later to the Shifts Template page and the shifts are regenerated any individually created shifts will be lost.
  * **Creating customized shifts is rare.** Shift templates are used to generate shifts; and though custom shifts are useful for specific situations they are rare.  You will likely not need them.

===== FAQ =====
  * **Do I need to create custom shifts?** No.  If a shift template has been created for each combination of Facility Resource and required Staff Resources for that facility the shift generator will produce all general shifts needed.
