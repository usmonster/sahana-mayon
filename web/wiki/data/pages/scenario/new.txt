====== Scenario Creator Walk-through ======

===== Scenario Creation =====

**What it does:**

Scenarios are generic.  A few examples of a scenario title are "**Volcano Plan**", "**Earthquake Response**", or "**Tsunami Evacuation**".  Later on, when an event is deployed as a scenario, the Event is given a specific name such as "Hurricane Earl" or "1999 Earthquake".  Scenarios can be built to be pre-Zero Hour sheltering or post-Zero Hour response; but more on that later.
===== Reference Information =====

==== Things To Know ====
  * **Scenarios** are plans.  **Events** are the actualization of those plans.
  * **Scenarios** are general.  **Events** are specific.
  * Scenarios are stand-alone and all information in a scenario is specific to that scenario.  If you have multiple preparedness strategies that will be managed in Agasti you'll want to construct a scenario for each of them.

Use the **Name** field to title your scenario.  The name should be generic to the type of response you might deploy for a specific event.

Use the **Description** field to expand upon the name label.  

**Note:** Only the name field is required.

When you've added a name and description click "Save and Continue" and then click the "Next" button below.
===== FAQ =====

  - **Can I update the name and description later?** Yes, you can always edit a scenario from the Scenario List (reachable by visiting the Scenario Management page and clicking â€œList Scenarios").
  - **What is the difference between a scenario and an event?** - A scenario is a plan and all details in a scenario are relative, such as relative times to a zero hour that hasn't been set yet.  An event is a specific response and all the relative elements from the scenario that an event is based upon become specific; to keep with the time example, at the start of an event you will set zero hour to be a specific date and time.
