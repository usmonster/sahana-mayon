====== Scenario Creator Tutorial ======

===== Importing Facilities =====
As mentioned in [[scenario:resources|step 3]] of the Scenario Creator Tutorial, Facilities are imported as part of the scenario they are included in.  Facilities can be uploaded during Scenario Creation; but also after a scenario is created to help with keeping the scenario current.

===== Reference Information =====

==== Things to Know ====
  * The Facility Import template includes all the information on a facility resource, it's capacity, its activation sequence in a given scenario, and contact information. {{:manual:user:facilities:facility_import_and_export_template.xls|Facility Import Template}}
  * **Imported facilities are directly related to specific scenarios.** When importing a facility you're required to select the scenario that import sheet relates to.
  * Facilities can be imported as part of scenario creation, or uploaded regularly to keep Scenarios current.
  * Each row in import is for a Facility Resource.  If a facility has more than one resource each resource will be a new line in the import spreadsheet.
