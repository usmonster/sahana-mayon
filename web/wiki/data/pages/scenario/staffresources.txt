====== Scenario Creator Walk-through ======

===== Staff Resource Requirements =====

**What it does:**

For Agasti to assign staff personnel to a facility the system must know how many of each type of staff is required for that facility to open.  In this step the minimum and maximum required staff will be entered for the facilities you included in your groups.
===== Reference Information =====

**Good things to know about Staff Resource Requirements.**:

  * Every facility must have at least one staff type with staff assigned (otherwise, there will be facilities open without staff in them).
  * Not every facility needs to have every staff type assigned. (Shelters without medical facilities don't need doctors).
  * If you assign a minimum you must assign a maximum.
  * The facilities are broken up by group, so if there are multiple groups they will be listed with the facilities together in the order you put them in when creating your facility groups.
