====== Scenario Creator Walk Through ======

===== Pre-Creation =====

**What it does:**

Because a scenario is used to plan staff and facility resource deployment it's important that you have added your staff and facilities to Sahana Agasti before planning a Scenario.  

**If you have not entered staff and facility details to Agasti, click the links in Sahana Agasti to do so now before continuing with the Scenario Creator.**
You can use the [[manual:user:staff:staff_creation_walkthrough|Staff Management Walk-Through]] or [[manual:user:facilities:facilities_management_walkthrough|Facility Management Walk-Through]] as a guide.

===== Walk-Through =====

The three links on this page each perform a separate action:

{{:scenario:prescenario.png?600|Before You Start}}

  * Click **"Continue and Create a Scenario"** if you have already uploaded or entered your staff and facilities.
  * Click **"Exit Scenario Creator and Edit Facilities"** if you have facilities records to enter.
  * Click **"Exit Scenario Creator and Edit Staff"** if you have staff records to enter.

If you're ready to continue, click "Continue and Create a Scenario" and then the next button below.  If not, return to the [[manual:user:staff|Staff Management Instructions]] or [[manual:user:facilities|Facility Management Instructions]] for assistance before creating your scenario.
===== FAQ =====
**Frequently Asked Questions:**

  * **Why do Scenarios need Facilities and Staff?** - Scenarios are plans for deploying different types of staff to different facilities in the affected area of your emergency response.  Agasti will need staff and facility records to use for these plans and you, as the users, will use specific information within the system to build your plan.
  * **I only have some of my staff and facilities in the system, can I create a Scenario and update it later?"** - Yes!  You can always edit a scenario from the Scenario List (reachable by visiting the Scenario Management page and clicking "List Scenarios).  It's fine to get started now and come back later with more details.
  * **Will I be able to update my staff before I create an Event later?** - Yes.  Because people aren't assigned to respond until the scenario is turned into an event staff lists can be updated at any time until the event is deployed.  Sahana Agasti uses Staff Resource Types and not individual staff members in Scenario planning and you can add more staff later.  They will be automatically assigned based on the Deployment Priority rules made in the Scenario Creator.
