==== Updating Via Export/Import ====
If you want to use export/import for updating facilities in a scenario:
  * Follow the instructions above to export the facility information for this Scenario
  * Update the facility records in the spreadsheet.  Be sure to:
    * Keep all Facility Codes unique for each physical facility
    * Only assign one of each Facility Resource Type to each facility
  * Click the "Next" button below for information about Facility import

===== FAQ =====
  * **Can I customize the fields available for export?** - Agasti currently supports a bulk export of all facilities without custom fields. To create a facility export with custom fields remove the undesired information from the spreadsheet produced by the export.
