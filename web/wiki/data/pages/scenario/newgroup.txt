====== Scenario Creator Walk-Through (fgr) ======

===== Facility Group Creation =====

**What it does:**

Facility groups are just that: groups of facilities.  Facilities can be grouped for many reasons including activation order, geographical location, or type of resources.  
===== Reference Information =====

It's important to understand what facility groups are used for later on; though hard to know so early in Scenario creation.  Here are some additional details that may be helpful.

**Good things to know about Facility Groups:**
  * The deployment order for the **group** is set at the text box at the top.  The deployment order of the **facility resources** is set by it's order in the right side select box.
  * Groups are specific to the scenario they're in; so a group in one scenario can be completely different in another (even if they're called the same thing).
==== Important Concepts ====

=== What Facility Groups Are Used For ===

  * Including and Excluding Facility Resources from your Scenario - Any facility resource not included in a group will not be made available when your scenario becomes an event.  **Note: If you want to have a facility available, even on stand by, be sure to include it in a facility group.**
  * Distribution of Resources at Deployment - During the deployment of an event facilities come on line in an order specified by facility group.  The facilities activated first will get resources and staff first.
  * Reporting and Data - After an event is activated information about that event is reported a few ways; and some of those reports are specific to facility groups.
===== Walk-Through =====

  - To begin the creation of your first facility group **assign the required properties**; give it a unique name, select the type of group, the status it will take when an event is created, and the order it should activate in relation to the other groups.
  - Next select the facilities and resources you'll use and drag & drop them from the left to the right column.
  - After you've selected the resources for this group you can "Save and Create Another" or, if you're only making one group, "Save and Continue".
  - If you "Save and Create Another" the groups you have already created will list at the top of the page.  Repeat 1 through 3 until all groups have been created and then select "Save and Continue".

After all groups have been created select the "Next" button below.

===== FAQ =====

  - **Do I need any facility groups?** - Yes.  Facility groups are how facility resources are included in the scenario, and therefore an event when it's activated.  Every scenario needs at least one facility group.
  - **Can I have only one facility group?** - Yes, one is enough; however a scenario can have as many facility groups as are necessary for planning.
