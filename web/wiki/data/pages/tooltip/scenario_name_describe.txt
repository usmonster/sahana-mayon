===== Scenario Name =====
Ideally, Scenarios are named for the type of emergency response they are used for.  Examples include:
  * "Earthquake Response" for earthquakes
  * "Flooding Shelter Plan" to house flood victims
  * "Tornado Aid Distribution" for dispersing relief donations in a tornado response

Scenario names are used throughout Sahana Agasti as a label.
