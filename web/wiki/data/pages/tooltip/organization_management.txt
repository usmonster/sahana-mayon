===== Organizations =====
In Sahana Agasti, Organizations are used to group staff resources for scenario planning and, later, deployment.

Organizations can mean municipal departments or non-government organizations that are made available during a response.  During scenario creation groups of staff resources can be prioritized by organization affiliation in the staff pool.
