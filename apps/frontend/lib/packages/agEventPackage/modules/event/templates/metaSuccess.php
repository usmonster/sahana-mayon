<h2>Event Management</h2>
<p>Event deployment depends largely on when the event will begun/began.  To facilitate pre-deployment
settings and the activation of the event's resources, please provide a name for the event and
the Zero Hour.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> the name should be specific.  For example: a hurricane response to Hurricane Erica could
be named "Erica" in Agasti.</p>
