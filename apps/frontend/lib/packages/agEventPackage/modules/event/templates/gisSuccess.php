<h2>Event Management</h2>
<?php
//note for devs: anytime you see <b>Name Of Event</b> it's my placeholder for where you should make
//the app display the name of the event the user is working in.
?>
<p>In order to effectively add staff to the facilities in <b>Event Name</b> distances between the staff and 
  facilities must be calculated.  Most have been done before this event, however:</p>

<h3>Name of Event Pre-Deployment</h3>
<i>Number of facilities to be coded.</i><br>
<i>Number of staff to be coded.</i><br>
<b>Button to geo code all.</b><br>

<p>When all addresses have been coded the distances should be calculated.</p>
<b>Button to calc distance.</b><br>
<?php
//when it's calculated successfully they should be directed back to the final step.
