<p>In order for staff to be assigned to facilities they must first report as being available.
  Agasti will use the Staff Deployment Priority rules created during pre-deployment to generate the
  staff for this event and create an export, using the "Generate All Staff Contact List" button below,
  for staff to be contacted.</p>

<b>Generate All Staff Contact List</b> button as an export<br>

<p>After staff have replied to the external messaging system please import their replies.</p>
<b>Import Staff Replies</b> button.<br>

<p>Finally, after replies have been imported Agasti will assign available staff to facilities.
  Assigned staff will be messaged a second time with their shift assignment and where to report.</p>
