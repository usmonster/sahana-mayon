//note for devs: anytime you see *Name Of Event* it's a placeholder for where you should make
//the app display the name of the event the user is working in.

// This page is currently a stub!  The following random string is a marker for the stub.

// PLEASE REMOVE THIS COMMENT BLOCK WHEN YOU DEVELOP THIS PAGE!

//You should probably add a confirmation that the event was deployed here when it's first created.

This is a placeholder. Reporting will likely be it's own module.
