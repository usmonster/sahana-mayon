SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

*** IMPORTANT NOTE: ***

This software has been tested with the following technology stack, though other
platforms, web servers, and database engines may be supported with some
additional work. All documentation for this version of the software, however,
will assume the following setup:

Software
--------

The following software is required to run Sahana Agasti Mayon:

* Ubuntu 9.10 LTS or later (most current 10.04 LTS strongly recommended)
* Apache HTTP Server 2.2.14 or later (most current 2.2 preferred)
* MySQL 5.1.41 or later (most current 5.1 preferred)
* PHP 5.2.12 or later (most current 5.3 strongly recommended)

* Intel Pentium or AMD Athlon CPU
* minimum of 50 MB available disk space
* minimum 512 MB RAM


INSTALLATION
============

For installation instructions, please see the included INSTALL file.


KNOWN ISSUES AND WORKAROUNDS
============================

IMPORTANT GENERAL NOTE: this is the initial release for the Mayon (2.0) series
of Sahana Agasti. The development team is aware that there are various kinks,
quirks, and that existing functionality and usability is limited. The software
is therefore NOT INTENDED FOR GENERAL USE in its current state.

This list covers some of the known problems (and workarounds, where applicable)
with Agasti 2.0 Mayon, which will be resolved in future releases:

- After submitting the form on the install.php page, it may take up to 5 minutes
  to load and redirect to the login screen.

- The "Client" menu navigation item points to home; this module will be
  implemented in a future release.

- Pre-loaded fixtures for staff are not searchable; this is because fixture data
  is not currently indexed for searching when populating the schema through the
  install process. Any new data entered into the system, however, will be
  searchable.

- Sorting a list of Staff by name is currently buggy and may not sort correctly.

- It is currently not possible to add more than one service to a Facility
  Group's list of available resources.

- Editing user accounts is unstable and may fail with an error page.

- Omitting a date of birth when creating or editing a staff entry will fail with
  an error.

- Form validation has not been turned on in most places, so it is possible to
  enter invalid data into the system.

- The formatting on some pages may seem "off." Page elements may wrap or
  disappear based on your browser window size or screen resolution. As a
  temporary workaround, you may need to maximize your browser window or increase
  your screen resolution.

If you think you've found a new issue or bug, please refer to the SUPPORT
section of this document for information on what to do next.
